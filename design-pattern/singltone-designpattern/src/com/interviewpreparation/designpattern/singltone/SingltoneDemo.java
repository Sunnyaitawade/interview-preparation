package com.interviewpreparation.designpattern.singltone;
//   In Java, Singleton is a design pattern that ensures that a class can only have one object.
//     To create a singleton class, a class must implement the following properties:
//       1. Create a private constructor of the class to restrict object creation outside of the class.
//       2. Create a private attribute of the class type that refers to the single object.
//       3. Create a public static method that allows us to create and access the object we created.
//          Inside the method, we will create a condition that restricts us from creating more than one object.
public class SingltoneDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
